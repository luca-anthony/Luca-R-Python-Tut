Welcome.
Welcome Luca.
This is a tutorial for Python and PyGame for Luca M. Roldan.
Made by: Luca O. Anthony

The tutorial will be inscribed in sections called "ATS."
The sections are called ATS as it is an acronym for Articulated Technical Sections.
Let's start.

ATS 1: Installments

A key thing to do in programming is to have an IDE, or, an Integrated Development Environment.
A IDE I use is Visual Studio Code, or, VS Code.
This is an IDE that can be used for coding in almost any language. C, C#, Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, ETC.
It is a programmers go-to environment for coding.
Here is how you will install it.



ATS 2: VS Code Extensions

You should already have VS Code running if you followed the directions in ATS 1, but, if you don't run the program by searching VS Code in the windows search menu and press enter or click the "open application" button to run it.
Once it is running you will have to go to the extensions section on the sidebar, the icon will look like the image below.

After entering the menu search "Python" in the bar.
You should see a Python Extension Pack by Don Jayamanne, click on it and press "Install" then "Enable" once it is installed. (It may be already enabled automatically.)
After that install any other extensions that are by Microsoft if they are not installed already.
Then seach "Pygame" in the extensions bar and download "Pygame Snippets" by Taiwo Kareem. Enable it as well.
Close the extensions bar by clciking on the icon again.

ATS 3: File Creation

Now that you have VS Code and Python as well as all the extensions, we are going to create the code folder as well as your files.
Open the file manager on your Windows OS by going to the search menu and searching "File Explorer"

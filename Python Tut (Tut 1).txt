Welcome.
Welcome Luca.
This is a tutorial for Python and PyGame for Luca M. Roldan.
Made by: Luca O. Anthony

The tutorial will be inscribed in sections called "ATS."
The sections are called ATS as it is an acronym for Articulated Technical Sections.
Let's start.

ATS 1: Installments

A key thing to do in programming is to have an IDE, or, an Integrated Development Environment.
A IDE I use is Visual Studio Code, or, VS Code.
This is an IDE that can be used for coding in almost any language. C, C#, Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, ETC.
It is a programmers go-to environment for coding.
Here is how you will install it.

1: Go to the "Installs" folder on the root of the SD Card.
2: Double click on the VSCodeUserSetup-x64-1.105.1
	This is the most recent VS Code installer that will give you the most recent version of VS Code.
3: Follow all the instructions it gives you then run the program.

4: Go back to the "Installs" folder on the root of the SD Card.
5: Double click on the python-3.14.0-amd64
	This is the most recent version of Python.
6: Follow the installer instructions carefully.
	If you see the option check the "Add python.exe to PATH" option as this will allow you to run python files straight from your computer.
7: Open the Command Prompt by searching "cmd" in the windows search menu and run the command "python --version" to verify the install.

ATS 2: Running

You should already have VS Code running if you followed the directions in ATS 1, but, if you don't run the program by searching VS Code in the windows search menu and press enter or click the "open application" button to run it.
Once it is running you will have to go to the extensions section on the sidebar, the icon will look like the image below.
